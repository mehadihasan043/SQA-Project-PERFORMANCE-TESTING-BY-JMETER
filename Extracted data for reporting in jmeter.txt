 Extracted data for reporting in jmeter-------
Dear, 

I’ve completed performance test on frequently used API for https://reqres.in/. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server side. 

500 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is 16.67 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1000.
800 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is 26.67 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1600.
1000 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is 33.33 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2000.


While executed 1000 concurrent request, found  50 request got connection timeout and error rate is 2.50%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 900 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries.
